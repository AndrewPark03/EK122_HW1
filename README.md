# EK122_HW1
Yajaira Herrera, Mingi Park, Mirclea Tan

The purpose of this homework assignment is to get you thinking about analyzing data sets. You will use data from a course that is similar to EK 122 in that it has class and lab attendance grades, quizzes, exams, and homework and project assignments (although this class was a full 4 credit course). There are two semesters, one Fall and one Spring. Your job is to make sense of all of this data and make inferences. You are to document your process using Live Editor, which will describe your decision-making, have your code, and and produce output such as plots and charts. Do not just document using comments in your code. Please write complete sentences using the text, as seen here.

First, download the data sets and analyze them. Do NOT use low-level file input for this! Follow the guidance in the respective Import the Data section.If you unsuppress the commands, you will see that there are hundreds of rows, and a lot of features! You will need to scrub the data. Use feature engineering techniques described in the Data Science and Machine Learning Supplements at the ends of the chapters in the text. Document what you decide to modify and why. (Note: if you remove features, you might want to create a new file so that you can go back and add the features back in if you decide to.)
1) import the data
2) scrub data (isnan) datascience and machine elarning
3) document what you decide to modify and why

Perform some statistical analyses on the data. You have to decide what is relevant and important, and describe why. What kinds of conclusions can you draw? (You may not be able to actually draw conclusions based on only one yearâ€™s worth of data, but you can come up with hypotheses that could then be tested with more data.)
Are there correlations within the data set? Test this, and show results using plots and correlation coefficients.

In addition, note the Tips & Tricks section at the very end for some helpful guidance on vectorizing your code and learning some more advanced methods of programming.
4) what conclusions can we draw
5) are there correlations and prove these with coreelation coefficient and plots
You are to work in groups of 2 or 3. Submit one document as a .pdf that describes your process, and your results (to Gradescope). Be creative! You will be in competition with other groups in terms of usefulness and creativity. Keep in mind that this is an open-ended assignment. There is no one correct process or way of thinking. Read through the entire .mlx as a guide to get you started, but have fun with it! This is due on Monday, March 27th by 10am EDT. The work must be done this semester, in groups.
